<p style="text-align:center"> I am currently in my second semester of freshman year at the University of Maine. I am currently majoring in finance. When I came to school here I did not know any other freshman, and have been able to meet so many people because of this. I am currently living in the dorm Androscoggin Hall. Living in the dorms have been an interesting experience, but I do not plan on living in another dorm for the rest of my studies here!
